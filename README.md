# STIB Metro Route Finder - JavaFX Project

## Description

This project is a **JavaFX** application that helps users find possible metro routes within the STIB network. Users can enter a starting metro station and a destination, and the app will display all possible routes to reach their destination. The application uses JavaFX for the user interface and Scene Builder for creating the UI layout.

## Features

- **Input Metro Stations**: Users can select or type the source and destination stations from the list of available metro stops in the STIB network.
- **Display Possible Routes**: The application calculates and shows all possible routes between the selected metro stations.
- **Favorite Routes**: Users can save frequently used routes to a favorites list for quick access later.
- **Graphical User Interface**: A clean, intuitive user interface designed using JavaFX and Scene Builder.
- **Real-time Updates**: When the user changes the selected source or destination, the possible routes update automatically.
- **Error Handling**: Displays warnings if the input is invalid, such as selecting the same station for both source and destination.

## Technologies Used

- **JavaFX**: Used for building the graphical user interface.
- **Scene Builder**: Used for designing the UI with an XML-based layout.
- **Java**: The backend logic is implemented in Java, handling user input and route calculations.
- **FXML**: Used to define the interface structure in a declarative way.
